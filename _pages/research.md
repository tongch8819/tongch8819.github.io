## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Shared Policy for Cloud Quota Management Problem

Abstract: Quota is often used in resource allocation and management scenarios to prevent abuse of resource and increase the efficiency of resource utilization. Quota management is usually done with a set of rules maintained by the system administrator. However, maintaining these rules usually needs deep domain knowledge and arbitrary rules may not guarantee both high resource utilization and fairness at the same time. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to automatically respond to quota requests in cloud computing platforms with distinctive usage characteristics for different users. Specifically, we design a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with shared policy to resolve the challenges induced by heterogeneous and high dimensional continuous action space in the quota management problem. Furthermore, a reward communication mechanism is incorporated among different agents to balance the efficiency and fairness according to the system requirements. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of our framework on both efficiency and fairness in cloud quota management problem and efficacy of reward communication among agents to achieve efficiency and fairness trade-off.
