Welcome to Tong (Tom) Cheng’s homepage.

I am now a first-year Master’s student in Beijing Normal University, majoring in Computational Mathematics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.bnu.edu.cn).

Before returning back to BNU, I spent 6 months as a Software Development Engineer in [Baidu](https://ir.baidu.com). My responsibility includes the development of large-scale log analysis and search engine backend strategy optimization.

Prior to that, I was working both as research intern and research assistant in [ISCAS](http://www.iscas.ac.cn), focusing on the firmware analysis and software fuzzing techniques.

I have received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Beijing Normal University](http://www.bnu.edu.cn), where I was exposed to a wide variety of courses from different disciplines. Besides the math courses, I have also taken other courses like economics, computer science, which indeed broaden my horizons tremendously.

If you are interested in internship in ISCAS or Baidu, Please feel free to reach out. It's my honor to help you out!
