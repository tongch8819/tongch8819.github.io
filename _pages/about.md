Welcome to Tong Chengâ€™s homepage.

I am now a PhD student in Nanyang Technological University, conducting research in reinforcement learning, cloud distributed system and sub-modular optimization under the guidance of Associate Professor [Xueyan Tang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asxytang/).

I have received my B.S. in Mathematics and M.S. in Computational Mathematics (Mentor: Associate Professor [Li Cui](http://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/212930.htm)) from [Beijing Normal University](http://www.bnu.edu.cn), [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.bnu.edu.cn).
<!-- where I was exposed to a wide variety of courses from different disciplines. Besides the math courses, I have also taken other courses like economics, computer science, which indeed broaden my horizons tremendously. -->

I have also worked as intern from 2021 to 2023 in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), conducting research in reinforcement learning topics under the guidance of Senior Researchers [Hang Dong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hangdong/) and Lu Wang.

At 2021, I spent 6 months as a Software Development Engineer in [Baidu](https://ir.baidu.com), taking charge of the development of large-scale log analysis and search engine backend strategy optimization.

Prior to that, I have worked as research assistant in [ISCAS](http://www.iscas.ac.cn), focusing on the firmware analysis and software fuzzing techniques.

If you are interested in internship in MSRA, Baidu and ISCAS, feel free to reach out!
